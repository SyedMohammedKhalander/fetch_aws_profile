# AWS Profile Details Fetcher

This Python script fetches details of AWS IAM user profiles using Boto3 library, either from your local AWS configuration files or directly using AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. The fetched details are then stored in JSON format for further analysis and reference.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI configured with necessary IAM user credentials.
2. Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-profile-details-fetcher.git
   cd aws-profile-details-fetcher
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Fetch and Store Details from AWS Configuration Files

1. Run the script without providing AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to fetch details from your local AWS configuration files:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The script will read your AWS configuration files (`~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`), fetch profile details, and store them in `profile_details.json`.

### Fetch and Store Details using AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

1. Run the script by providing your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

   ```bash
   python main.py --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

2. The script will use the provided credentials to fetch details of the associated AWS IAM user and store them in `user_data.json`.

### Result

After running the script, you'll find the fetched profile details stored in either `profile_details.json` (when using configuration files) or `user_data.json` (when using provided Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment once you're done:

```bash
deactivate
```

Feel free to modify and extend the script to suit your specific requirements.

**Note**: Make sure to handle sensitive credentials securely and avoid sharing them in public repositories or documents.

## What Happens When You Don't Pass `key` and `secret` Arguments?

If you run the script without providing the `key` and `secret` arguments, the script will assume that you want to fetch and store details from your AWS configuration files (`~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`).

1. The script reads the AWS configuration files to identify available profiles and their corresponding access key IDs, secret access keys, regions, and output formats.

2. For each profile identified in the configuration files:
   - The script constructs a dictionary containing details like `aws_access_key_id`, `region`, and `output`.
   - It then uses the Boto3 library to establish a session with the AWS IAM service using the profile's access key ID and secret access key.
   - The script attempts to fetch the IAM user's details, including their ARN (Amazon Resource Name), username, creation date, and password last used date.
   - If the fetch is successful, the script converts the datetime objects to ISO 8601 compliant strings and constructs a data dictionary with the fetched details.
   - The data dictionary also includes a boolean value indicating whether the profile is valid (the IAM user details were fetched successfully).

3. After processing all profiles, the script constructs a list of data dictionaries for each profile. It then dumps this list to a JSON file named `profile_details.json` using the `json.dump` function. The JSON data is formatted with an indentation of 4 spaces for readability.

4. The script prints a message indicating that the data has been saved to `profile_details.json`.

In summary, if you don't pass the `key` and `secret` arguments, the script will fetch and store details of AWS profiles from your local configuration files, including their access key IDs, regions, and output formats. If the profiles are valid and IAM user details are fetched successfully, these details will also be included in the stored JSON data.
